# Web Scraper Project

## Overview

This project is a Python-based **Web Scraper** designed to extract data from websites efficiently. It demonstrates skills in web automation, data extraction, and handling HTML content using Python libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and optionally `Selenium` for dynamic content.

The tool is suitable for **learning web scraping techniques**, collecting structured data from web pages, and understanding the fundamentals of web automation.

## Features

* Fetch HTML content from target URLs.
* Parse and extract specific elements like text, links, images, and tables.
* Handle pagination or multiple pages.
* Export scraped data to CSV or JSON files.
* Optional browser automation for dynamic websites.
* Customizable scraping rules.

## Installation

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml selenium pandas
```

## Usage

1. Run the notebook or script:

```bash
jupyter notebook 'Web Scraper Project.ipynb'
```

2. Set the target URL(s) and define scraping rules.
3. Execute cells to fetch and parse data.
4. Export the collected data into CSV or JSON format.

## Notes

* Always respect website terms of service and robots.txt before scraping.
* For dynamic content (loaded via JavaScript), use Selenium or other browser automation tools.
* Avoid excessive requests to prevent being blocked by the server.
